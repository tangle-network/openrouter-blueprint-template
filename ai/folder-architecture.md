## Cursor Rules: Tangle Blueprint Project Structure

> These rules are mandatory for all Blueprint projects generated or modified by AI. The structure is non-negotiable unless explicitly overridden by a user instruction.

---

### 1. Required Directory and File Structure

Every Blueprint must follow this layout exactly at the root level:

```bash
.
├── .cargo/
├── .github/
├── contracts/                 # Solidity contracts used for job triggers or verification
├── {{name}}-bin/              # Binary crate, entry point for blueprint execution
│   ├── build.rs              # Build script for smart contracts and blueprint metadata
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs           # Runner initialization
├── {{name}}-lib/              # Library crate, contains logic, jobs, context, tests
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── lib.rs
│   └── tests/
├── .dockerignore
├── .envrc
├── .gitignore
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── foundry.toml              # Foundry config for contracts
├── remappings.txt            # Solidity import remappings
├── Dockerfile                # Optional runtime container setup
├── LICENSE-APACHE
├── LICENSE-MIT
└── README.md
```

> **Note:** Two naming conventions are supported:
> 1. Template-based: `{{name}}-bin/` and `{{name}}-lib/` (when using `cargo tangle blueprint create`)
> 2. Fixed naming: `bin/` and `blueprint/` (for some existing projects)
>
> Use whichever convention is already established in the project you're working with.

> **File placement is enforced. AI must not create Rust logic outside the library crate. The binary crate only initializes the runner.**

---

### 2. Crate Responsibilities

#### {{name}}-bin/
- Initializes the Blueprint environment and runner (where producers, consumers, routers, and contexts are defined and passed to the BlueprintRunner).
- Contains `build.rs` script for contract compilation and `blueprint.json` generation.
- No application logic allowed.

#### {{name}}-lib/
- All jobs, context structs, consumers, producers, utilities, and tests reside here.
- Use `src/lib.rs` to expose modules such as `jobs`, `context`, `utils`.

---

### 3. Special File Requirements

#### `README.md`
- Must include:
  - Summary of blueprint service w/ directory structure and breakdown of app, service, smart contract system.
  - Description of job responsibilities.
  - Instructions for testing using `TangleTestHarness`.

#### `Dockerfile`
- Optional.
- If included, must support blueprint runtime (e.g., installing `solc`, `forge`, or `cargo`).

---

### 4. Contracts Directory (`/contracts`)
- Contains Solidity contracts used by the Blueprint service.
- All contracts must compile using `forge build` or a supported browser compiler.
- If compiled in-browser (e.g., via Remix-like WASM), artifacts must be output to a `.forge-artifacts/` or `.compiled/` directory.

---

### 5. Optional Frontend

- A `/frontend/` directory may be added if the Blueprint includes a user interface.
- Must be a self-contained app (e.g., Vite + TS + Tailwind).
- Must not interfere with the blueprint execution layer.
- If present, frontend build artifacts should be ignored by `.gitignore`.

---

### 6. Testing Requirements

All Blueprint projects must include appropriate tests:

- Tests must be located in `{{name}}-lib/tests/` or `{{name}}-lib/src/jobs/tests.rs`
- Each job handler must have at least one integration test
- See [testing-requirements.md](testing-requirements.md) for comprehensive testing standards and examples

---

### 7. Naming Conventions

- All crates and folders use `kebab-case`.
- All Rust files use `snake_case`.
- All exported types use `PascalCase`.
- All constants (e.g., job IDs) use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

---

### 8. Valid Project Initialization

Blueprints must be initialized using the following canonical command:

```bash
cargo tangle blueprint create --name my_service
```

This ensures:
- Proper `-bin` and `-lib` separation
- Hook and Dockerfile generation
- Metadata templating via `Cargo.toml.liquid`

---

### 9. AI Enforcement Rules

- MUST place `BlueprintRunner` setup in the binary crate's `main.rs`.
- MUST define a `Context` struct in the library crate's `src/context.rs`.
- MUST keep smart contract code isolated in `/contracts`.
- MUST NOT place any Blueprint logic in the binary crate besides initialization.
- MUST NOT rely on the binary crate for job handlers, context definitions, or other application logic.
